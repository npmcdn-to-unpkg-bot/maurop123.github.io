Hello friend. My name is Mauro.
<br><br>
I've made some things. Like...
<br><br>

<br><br>
I was the first hire of a company called Biznobo, and we made a tool for email marketers to connect their email accounts, like Mailchimp, GetResponse, and Aweber, to user actions all over business owners' websites to automate personalized marketing based on marketing funnels.

I'm working on an app to let users track and learn anything about themselves.

Which is a part of this organization: LEAD Projects.
